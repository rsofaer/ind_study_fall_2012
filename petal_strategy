Let G be the input graph, G=(V,e,w)

Construct G', G' has rounded edge weights, as follows:
  Sort the edges of G by corresponding weight.
  then use algorithm implemented in roundlengths to reduce the number of distict lengths
    start at the smallest length, set the current target to that,
    for each subsequent length,
      if it is greater than the twice the target,
        set the target to that length
      set the current length to the target

Now we know from their proof that a low-stretch tree in G' is low-stretch in G
